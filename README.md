This program counts letters, words, and vowels in a sentence. You type one letter at a time, and it stops when you type a dot (.).

How It Works
1. What It Counts
Letters: Every letter, space, and the final dot

Words: Groups of letters separated by spaces

Vowels: The letters A, E, I, O, U (both small and capital)

2. Step-by-Step
Start with all counters at 0

Ask for the first letter

Keep asking for letters until you type a .

For each letter:

Add +1 to letters

If it's a vowel, add +1 to vowels

If it's a new word (after a space), add +1 to words

At the end:

Add +1 for the final dot

Check if there's one last word

Show the results

3. Example
You type:
H → i → (space) → w → o → r → l → d → .
Program says:

Total letters: 9 (including the dot)  
Total words: 2 ("Hi" and "world")  
Total vowels: 3 (i, o)  

4. Try It Yourself!
Just follow the steps:

Start counting letters

Type letters one by one

When done, type .

See your results!

Note:

Spaces separate words

The dot . ends the counting

Works even with empty input (just a .)
